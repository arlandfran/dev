# About me

I’m Arland Fran Torres, (aspiring) developer and minimalist.

Currently I work in field marketing, but I’m looking for opportunities in software development.

My interests are in digital accessibility, workflow automation and data visualizations. I’m also a big horror & science fiction fan.
