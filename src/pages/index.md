# About me

I’m Arland Fran Torres, (aspiring) developer and minimalist, based in the UK.

Currently I work as a Microsoft Sales Advisor, but I’m looking for opportunities in software development.

My interests are in digital accessibility, workflow automation and data visualizations. I’m also a big horror & science fiction fan.

## What I'm up to [now](https://nownownow.com/about)

I’m in the middle of reworking my site and giving my portfolio projects a refresh. Lately, I’ve been getting way too many server failure emails from Render, so I’m planning to move everything over to Cloudflare (or another service) and take the chance to modernize the tech stack while I’m at it.
